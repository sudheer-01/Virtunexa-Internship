# Java Development Internship Projects â€“ Virtunexa

This repository contains four Java-based projects developed as part of my **Java Developer Internship** at **Virtunexa** (Jan 2025 â€“ Feb 2025). These projects helped me apply core Java concepts in real-world use cases, covering GUI, logic development, string handling, and scheduling systems.

 ðŸ§  Projects Included

# Digital Clock (GUI)
- Built a real-time clock using **Java Swing** with live hour, minute, second updates.
- Applied multithreading for time updates and used Java Timer class.

# Console-Based Adventure Game
- Developed a text-based game with branching storylines and user decision-making.
- Implemented nested conditions and loops to simulate real-time adventure choices.

# Palindrome Checker
- Designed a utility to verify whether a number or string is a palindrome.
- Used string manipulation, two-pointer techniques, and conditional checks.

# Timetable Generator
- Developed a **constraint-based scheduling system** for schools and colleges.
- Generated dynamic timetables based on **subject allocation** and **teacher availability**.
- Practiced object-oriented design, array handling, and Java collections.
